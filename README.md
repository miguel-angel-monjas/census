# Miscellaneous repo for visualizations based on census sections in Spain

This repo contains miscellaneous data and tools used to carry out visualizations based on census sections in Spain. The main focus is Madrid.

The census sections can be extracted from the [INE website](https://www.ine.es/ss/Satellite?L=es_ES&c=Page&cid=1259952026632&p=1259952026632&pagename=ProductosYServicios%2FPYSLayout), in shape format. You can find them in the `data/` folder (split by autonomous community, with the [ISO_3166-2 codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2:ES) to identify each community) in geoJSON format (thanks to [@Saigesp](https://github.com/Saigesp)).
